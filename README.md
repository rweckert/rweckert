👋 Hi, I’m @rweckert. my name is Robert Eckert. I have been in the industry for over 20 years which had started as a hobby in the 70's and ongoing to recently updating my degree to include Data Sciences. I am a database administrator and developer with years of IT administration experience. My technology stack involves Apache, PHP, MySQL, SQLite, MSS, HTML/CSS/Bootstrap. Besides programming, I have an immense interest in music and nature as well as helping others.

- 👀 I’m interested in ... lots of things.
I enjoy nature, camping, biking, skateboarding, surfing, writing music. Hobbies include maps, reading, and mechanics. Dedicated loving dad. Huge fan of music and helping others.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... tons of scripts.
I am keeping my knowledge of PowerShell scripting at the moment from getting rusty. Embedding a PowerShell dashboard with Apache management.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... tons of data.
I would like to collaborate on projects that bring complicated data sets to the surface for every day use.
