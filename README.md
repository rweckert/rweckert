👋 Hi, I’m @rweckert. my name is Robert and my friends call me Robb. With two "b's" 👀 is correct. :-)
I have been working with type writers connected to microchips since the mid 80's. Texas Instruments, TRS-80, Apple IIc and a Vic 20 paved the way to a IBM compatible clone in 1987 when I was 15. At this time, Xerox and Apple were way ahead of Microsoft game in regards to a graphic user interface. At that time I hacked my Radio Shack 300 baud modem to my IBM clone and started using the KERMIT protocol in hacking AT&T analog systems and city water treatment plants.
That was a ton of fun, and it has been a great place in life to see the growth of computers in every day life.

In fact in writing this, I will be taking a look at how others write their own README profile documents, and adding to this a bit more as an updatee shortly.
I have so much to share to the community, and excited to have the chance to do so.

- 👀 I’m interested in ... lots of things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... tons of scripts.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... tons of data.
